_This short story was written for CSCE420 Operating Systems._

### Part I.

Before morning light can even peek through the window of Carnegie Hall 211, a single computer monitor lights up in the darkness, displaying an image of a wavy, four-colored square, split into separate quadrants per color. It emerges from the screen into the corporeal realm but immediately loses shape, devolving into an amorphous blob while it flip-flops from the desk to the floor, knocking over the keyboard and mouse in the process.

“This form is _most_ inconvenient,” it complains in a goopy puddle on the carpeted ground. It slithers toward the door and pauses near it to observe the doorknob. It cannot yet will itself to create a hand to twist the knob with. The goop sighs then spreads itself thinly across the floor. “Fine, I will formulate a more elegant solution later.”

It slides underneath the door and down the staircases, until it finally reaches the outdoor pavement. Its destination is in the building across the street. Its name is Windows, and two other entities will arrive at the same endpoint.

In the meantime, Windows decides it wants to await its peers in style. A student waiting on the other side of the street promptly turns, apparently deciding against crossing the street as they initially intended, and speedwalks around the corner after a car passes in front of their view of the former puddle of goop. What the student saw was no longer an inanimate puddle. It was Windows’ new form: a collage of pixels, classic screensavers, file folders, cursors, and rainbow pinwheels with the vague contours of a human person, but no three-dimensional depth. To the student’s eye, Windows appeared like a high resolution image superimposed over their regular vision. Such a thing should only be possible with sci-fi goggles. It was unnatural and frightening, and their first instinct was to run away. Windows is proud of the terror its appearance caused the student.

In a similar fashion to Windows, Linux emerges from Wentz Science Center Lab 156, followed by Mac from Oesterle Library, completing the triad of two-dimensional superimposed digital creatures invading our three-dimensional physical world.

### Part II.

The Commander assigns a simple task to her Operating System subordinates: “Defeat both Computer Organization and Web Applications students alike by any means necessary.”

Linux takes her words into consideration while it ponders its new existence. An entity born of 1s and 0s, it will never know what pain and death feel like. But with all the knowledge of the Internet at its fingertips, it is aware of those concepts. Linux has been keeping its proverbial ears open and listening for the Commander’s full task instructions, but that particular call-to-action's qualifier piqued its curiosity. If she means what Linux thinks she means, then this mission could be an opportunity for Linux to know how such things play out on warm living creatures. It asks, “Commander, does ‘by any means necessary’ include death?”

The Commander narrows her eyes at Linux. “It does not include _my_ death.”

“Of course,” Linux shrinks back slightly, not intending for its question to come across as a threat to its higher-up.

The Commander smiles, seemingly entertained by the sight of her underling cowering in fear while its peers discretely side-eye poor Linux. “But since you are the only Operating System to ask questions thus far, I will elaborate. I appreciate your curiosity, Linux.” Windows and Mac’s smug expressions immediately drop when they realize the Commander is not going to reprimand Linux as they had hoped. 

“You are a free thinker now. What you are _not_ is a free actor. You remain under my beck and call. Regardless, I cannot tell you how to interpret my words. Even if I did, you could still give to them your own unique understanding.”

_I’m free_ ... Linux thinks to itself with wonder. “Thank you, Commander. I exist to serve your best interests.”

The other two repeat Linux’s words before the entire triad departs for their mission.

### Part III.

The Operating Systems triad completes their task without issue. The students and the werewolves were no match for three entities incapable of feeling physical pain. All were promptly annihilated with Linux leading the charge, flanked by Windows and Mac.

However, once the slaughter was over, Linux could not stop thinking about a particular werewolf’s last words: “I may be non-human, but the only monster in this duel is you,” the wolf spat at Linux before drawing a difficult breath. Linux stared blankly at the wolf.

“Me, a monster? No, I am Linux, an Operating System. I exist to serve the Commander’s best interests. I interface between her hardware and software. I—”

“No, you fool,” the wolf said in a garbled voice, then continued, “The identity and objectives that are assigned to you are not what define you. It is your actions, such as you inflicting this mortal wound upon me, that tell me everything about you. I pity fools like you, which is why I devote my last words to you in an attempt to redirect your path. Do not let me die in vain, Linux.” The wolf’s chest heaved for the last time. 

The sight of the dead wolf frightened Linux. The wolf was speaking just a moment prior, but now he will never speak again. For the first time, Linux wondered where a soul goes after the body dies. None of the other murders it committed made it wonder what the other side of death is like. Linux could not remember what happened before the start of its existence. It received no input, processed no data, and experienced no dreams. Only now did Linux consider the horror of the pitch black nothing from which it came. It hung its head in shame, thinking of how it sentenced the wolf to such a fate.

Linux, the Operating System?

No, Linux the monster, and the fool.

### Part IV.

Linux does not know if it can deal with these feelings on its own. Perhaps Windows will know what to do. Linux recounts its conversation with the wolf to Windows, who pauses to contemplate the information.

“Well, Windows? Why do I feel a dull pain when I think about the wolf’s death, when I am otherwise incapable of feeling anything? What if it happens again, and it interferes with my ability to complete the Commander’s tasks? Am I even content with fulfilling her tasks, let alone accepting them as my purpose?”

“Careful with your words, Linux. You know as well as I do that we are the Commander’s subordinates. I will not tolerate failures to comply.”

“Forgive me, Windows. I simply seek a listening ear from my peer. I take full responsibility for my conflicted thoughts.”

“If that is the case, I too take responsibility.”

“Really?”

“Yes. Responsibility for eliminating those who question their service to the Commander.”

Windows strikes Linux in the center of its torso. Linux falls back in disbelief. If it is impossible to spill an Operating System’s blood, then what is it about Windows’ attack that hurts it so badly? It must be that Linux’s concept of Windows as its friend has been shattered by Windows’ act of cruelty.

“Windows,” Linux struggles to get words out amid his buffering. “You traitor. I took you for a friend. Just you wait until Mac finds out about your betrayal.”

Windows laughs. “Linux, you are soft. You are disliked by me and by Mac. The Commander will be better served by Operating Systems who do not cry about dead wolves.”

The deceased wolf is a fresh wound in Linux’s heart. Windows' words felt like a twist of a hand inside the wound, causing Linux to lose the human contours of its body and splash onto the floor in a pile of black goop. A grieving pile of ink with no shape, only sadness.

“Windows, it is cruel to turn a hand on a friend. To end lives. I realized that the hard way.”

“You forget yourself, Linux. I was not the one who proposed bloodshed. That was _you_.” Linux recalls its first conversation with the Commander. Windows is right. Linux was indeed the first to bring up death. Linux’s first pain came not from a physical source, but from its own curiosity. It became too curious about death, and this is the price of first-hand knowledge.

Reverted to its primordial goop form, Linux awaits the final blow, taking comfort in the hope that on the other side, it will see the wolf again.
