<p>Hello, welcome to my portfolio/blog site! My name is Sasha (she/her). I'm a Computer Engineering student 
at North Central College in Naperville, IL. This website is intended to be a hub for my credentials and 
(extra)curricular projects. The color scheme is inspired by <a href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin</a>, 
who I found via <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>'s in-app themes. The favicon and cursor icons are by me.</p>
